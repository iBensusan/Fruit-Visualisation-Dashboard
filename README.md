# Fruit Visualization Dashboard with Dash and Plotly

An interactive web application using Dash that visualizes the quantities of different fruits. Users can select a specific fruit from a dropdown menu, and the app will display a bar chart showing the amount of that fruit. This project is ideal for learning data visualization and building dynamic web dashboards with Python.

## Features

- **Interactive Dropdown Menu**: Allows users to select a fruit and dynamically updates the graph.
- **Data Visualization**: Uses Plotly to create visually appealing bar charts.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Dash for creating responsive web applications.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Dash
- Plotly
- Pandas

Install the required libraries with:
```bash
pip install dash plotly pandas
```
## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the project files:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/fruit-visualization-dashboard.git
    cd fruit-visualization-dashboard
    ```

2. Ensure you have Python 3 installed:

    ```bash
    python --version
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash

    ```

3. Use the dropdown menu to select a fruit and view the updated bar chart.

## Example Workflow

1. Start the application by running the script.
2. Open the web browser to access the dashboard.
3. Select a fruit from the dropdown menu (e.g., "Apples" or "Grapes").
4. Observe the dynamically updated bar chart displaying the selected fruitâ€™s amount.
